This repository contains code for generating images using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of images over multiple generations to create images that closely resemble a target image or pattern.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the image generation code on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you'll need:

- Python 
- Required Python libraries (list them if any, e.g., NumPy, OpenCV)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-generator-genetic-algo.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
     cd image-generator-genetic-algo
  

3. Install any necessary Python libraries:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   

### Usage

1. **Configuring Parameters:**
   
   - Open the `config.py` file to configure parameters for the genetic algorithm. You can adjust settings such as population size, mutation probability, and termination criteria.

2. **Target Image:**
   
   - Prepare the target image you want the genetic algorithm to generate. Place it in the project directory or specify its path in the code.

3. Run the Algorithm:
   
   - Execute the main algorithm script:
        python image_generator.py

4. **View Results:**
   
   - After running the algorithm, the best image from the final generation is saved in the project directory. You can view and analyze the generated image to see how closely it matches the target.

## Customization

You can customize the genetic algorithm by modifying the code to change the representation of images, the fitness function, and other parameters. Experiment with different settings to achieve the desired results.
